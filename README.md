### Description:

### Start

Video games are computer- or microprocessor-controlled games.
Computers can create virtual spaces for a wide variety of game types.
Some video games simulate conventional game objects like cards or dice,
while others can simulate environs either grounded in reality or fantastical in design,
each with its own set of rules or goals.

A computer or video game uses one or more input devices, typically a button/joystick combination (on arcade games);
a keyboard, mouse or trackball (computer games); or a controller or a motion sensitive tool (console games).
More esoteric devices such as paddle controllers have also been used for input.

There are many genres of video game;
the first commercial video game, Pong, was a simple simulation of table tennis.
As processing power increased,
new genres such as adventure and action games were developed that involved
a player guiding a character from a third person perspective through a series of obstacles.
This "real-time" element cannot be easily reproduced by a board game, which is generally limited to "turn-based" strategy;
this advantage allows video games to simulate situations such as combat more realistically.
Additionally, the playing of a video game does not require the same physical skill, strength or
danger as a real-world representation of the game, and can provide either very realistic, exaggerated or
impossible physics, allowing for elements of a fantastical nature, games involving physical violence, or
simulations of sports. Lastly, a computer can, with varying degrees of success, simulate one or
more human opponents in traditional table games such as chess, leading to simulations of
such games that can be played by a single player.

### My Game
It's a simple retro-game.
Some mechanics is based by Pong.
Player should manage their paddle and catch and reflect a ball.
Player's goal is destroying the structure of cubes.
Also, there is score in the top-right corner.
When player destroy a cube, they get 10, 20 or 40 points.
It depends on the round which player is playing.
“My Game” has 3 rounds (Easy, Middle and Hard) with different level of complicated.
Also, the ball become faster and faster with every reflection from the paddle and more complicate round.
If player couldn't catch the ball, they'll end the game.
Then player can see their result and restart a game.
If player won all of 3 rounds, they will see congratulation on the screen.

### Structure of the game

"My Game" consist some files and directories.
Sounds - there are sounds which are playing for a game.
04B_03.TTF - it's a type which is used for writing everything on the screen.
Ball.lua - class of the ball.
class.lua - helping file for using classes inside the game.
Cube.lua - class of the constructure of cubes.
main.lua - main fail of the game, which consist load, draw, update and another important function.
Paddle.lua - class of the paddle.
push.lua - helping file for managing and improving graphics of the game.
Game was written using Lua.
